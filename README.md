# Check-User-Agents
![alt-text](https://github.com/FabianOnSecurity/bypass-math-captcha/blob/main/images/math_bypass.jpg)
Sometimes there is a Website-Blocker for specific User-Agents. This tool is a multi-threaded checker for (approximately all) agents.

This script is multi-threaded.
## How to use
Start Python Tool and insert the url (and optional port):
```
http(s)://<url>:<port>/
```
5 Threads is the default value and recommended.

The "Show-200-Code" verbose mode prints all tries; including Status-Code 200.

## Codes
```
Code 200 Return is accepted by server.
Code 3xx, 4xx or 5xx is not accepted by server.
```
Please make sure, that the website-path is correct in general.
